                            <p>My one-and-a-half-year experience as a <span>web developer apprentice</span> at Yes We Dev has instilled in me important values such as <span>benevolence</span>, step-by-step progress <span>(&quot;babystep&quot;)</span>, <span>effective communication</span>, as well as the ability to <span>work asynchronously</span> and manage time. On the technical side, I have gained a expertise in technologies like WordPress Bedrock and Sage 10, along with a better understanding of the MVC model.<br/><br/> Furthermore, I had the opportunity to use <span>agile methods</span> and enhance my ability to adapt quickly to changes and collaborate effectively within a team. My time at Yes We Dev has been a crucial step in my professional development as a web developer.</p>
