On the technical side, I have gained a expertise in technologies like WordPress Bedrock and Sage 10, along with a better understanding of the MVC model.<br/><br/> Furthermore, I had the opportunity to use <span>agile methods</span> and enhance my ability to adapt quickly to changes and collaborate effectively within a team. My time at Yes We Dev has been a crucial step in my professional development as a web developer.</p>
