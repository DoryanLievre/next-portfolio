        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Passionate about computer science and new technologies since a young
          age, my first Legos were old computers, and I naturally pursued
          studies in this field. Today, I am currently looking for an apprenticeship/ permanent
          position.
          <br />
          In parallel, I continue to pursue my passion and expand my knowledge
          through courses such as awwwards or Udemy, and by reading books on
          development (currently CLEAN CODE). I am very curious and always
          strive to broaden my skill set.
